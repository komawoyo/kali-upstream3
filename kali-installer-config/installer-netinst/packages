# Network installer image with as little as possible
#
# Mostly empty list because netinst has no embedded packages in theory
# This variant is not meant to be used with live-build but only with simple-cdd
#
# ./build.sh --installer --variant netinst

## Metapackages
# For the complete list see: https://www.kali.org/tools/kali-meta/
# We still put kali-linux-firmware because we want firmware to be
# in the ISO for use by the installer
kali-linux-firmware
